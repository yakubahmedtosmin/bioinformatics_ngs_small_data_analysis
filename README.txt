You have been tasked with evaluating two competing methods of massively parralel DNA sequencing that the BioChemistry group is developing in tandem. Both methods are mechanistically similiar in that each subsequent cycle of sequencing is a physical continuation of the previous one; as a consequence, they both probe the positions of the DNA region to be sequenced in sequential order [i.e., cycle one of sequencing probes/"reads" position one of all DNA templates, cycle two reads position two, and so on and so forth]. Furthermore, both utilize four dyes (colors) to represent the four bases of DNA (ACGT) but the dye-base relationship ("red"-A, "blue"-C, etc.) is not the same for the different methods.

Each line of data corresponds to a different spot on a patterned array, where each spot contains a different sequence/segment of DNA to be sequenced. The entire array is imaged in all four dye channels to measure the amount of "color" emitting from each DNA spot after each cycle of sequencing chemistry. To put it simply, a spot is assigned a basecall (for that position) from the most prevalent color (highest signal intensity) of that spot for that particular cycle. 

The basecalls for the first cycle of both biochemistries have already been provided for you; however, it seems the image processing program was misconfigured for biochem2 (the dye-base pairing was incorrect). You will need to write your own Python script to generate calls for the second cycle of biochem1 and both cycles of biochem2 (after compensating for the software bug). As this experiment involved sequencing known DNA substrates, the true sequence (reference) is available for all positions (designated "ref" columns). Accordingly, the error rate associated with cycle one of biochem1 is 3.9%. 

Please provide your evaluation as you would to the biochemistry team. How would you suggest the research project progress from here? Your assessment should include a comparison for the accuracy of both sequencing methods and any additional findings that lead to your conclusion. Please attach any scripts you used to manipulate the data and conduct your analysis.
